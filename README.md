# PRG281-Project
-------------------

Programming 2nd Year Project at Belgium Campus.

If you are reading this then you're either a potential employer of mine or a cheeky BC student trying to copy code.

This README will act as a background on the work I, Lucien van Wyk, did in this miletstone project

-------------------
Behold, my stuff:
-------------------

I personally created everything front-end related as well as adding the backbone of the back-end by adding comments to sections that indicated to my team where they could add appropriate code that matches to sections of the front end. This helped speed up the coding process as my team knew how which sections could corresponded to parts of the front-end and back-end

Then obviously the back-end was a group effort.

I also did most of the code that queries the data from the sql database.
